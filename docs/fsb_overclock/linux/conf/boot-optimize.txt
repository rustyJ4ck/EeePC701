kernel boot parameters to improve stability

CPU

# grub config
# Windows-like timing environment:
clocksource=acpi_pm   # Stable timer like Windows
nohz=off              # Periodic interrupts like XP
highres=off           # Lower timer resolution
pcie_aspm=off         # No PCIe power management

# Stable performance profile:
intel_pstate=disable  # Simple frequency control
nowatchdog            # Don't panic on temporary hangs
mce=ignore_ce         # Don't log corrected errors

GPU

Edit /etc/default/grub and add the options to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX line, then run sudo update-grub.

# Disable clock gating and power management
i915.enable_rc6=0
i915.enable_dc=0
i915.disable_power_well=0

# Set the GPU to maximum frequency and lock it
i915.enable_pps=0
i915.use_mmio_flip=0

# Disable panel self-refresh (if using LCD)
i915.enable_psr=0

# Force a specific GPU frequency (if supported)
i915.enable_fbc=0
i915.lvds_downclock=0

# More aggressive: disable vsync and other features
i915.semaphores=1
i915.enable_hangcheck=0


intel_idle.max_cstate=1	Restricts the processor from entering deep power-saving "sleep" modes. 
						This prevents the GPU from losing power during the brief idle period when a game closes.
						Note: The intel_idle driver typically targets Core-series processors (Nehalem and newer) fall back to the generic acpi_idle driver.

i915.enable_psr=0		Disables Panel Self Refresh. PSR can cause hangs on exit when the driver attempts to hand control back to the desktop compositor.
						PSR stops the GPU from constantly sending identical image data to the screen when the display is static (still images like desktop)
						PSR is a frequent source of "micro-freezes," flickering, and full system hangs on Intel integrated graphics.
						Disabling PSR can 100% resolve random freezes and graphical glitches (like "FIFO underruns") on many Intel systems.
